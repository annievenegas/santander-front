        <h1><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong></h1>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
            versions
            of Lorem Ipsum.</p> &ensp;
        <h2>"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit..."</h2>
        <p>"There is no one who loves pain itself, <strong>who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is
                pain...</strong>"</p>&ensp;

        <h5>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin
            literature from 45 BC</h5>
        <h6>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
            some form, by injected humour, or randomised words</h6>
